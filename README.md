# 🏗️ Ameen — Builder in the Arena

I don't “work with” tech.  
I break it. I rebuild it. I ship it.  
Right now, I’m deep in Flutter, Rust, Solana, and AI agents.  
Tomorrow? Could be something completely different.

---

## ⚡ Current Build Mode
- Shipping [Ente Ward](https://github.com/...) — local governance app hitting real wards in Kerala.
- Cooking **AIMDAO** — AI-managed DAOs that don’t suck.
- Experimenting with Web3 voting for a *whole country* (Oman project).
- Random side quests: toy car e-commerce, AI dev tools, indie apps.

---

## 📅 This Month’s Energy
- 🛠️ Build → Ship → Feedback loop on 2 products  
- 🎯 Get 50+ real users giving angry, honest feedback  
- 🚀 Cut all “learning” work that doesn’t touch production

---

## 🖤 Build Philosophy
- No fake productivity tools. Trello boards rot. Docs collect dust.  
- If it’s not shipped, it doesn’t exist.  
- 80% done is just “not done”.
