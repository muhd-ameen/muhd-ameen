# 🏗️ Ameen — Builder in the Arena

I don't “work with” tech.  
I break it. I rebuild it. I ship it.  
Right now, I’m deep in Flutter, Rust, Solana, and AI agents.  
Tomorrow? Could be something completely different.

---

## ⚡ Current Build Mode
- Shipping [Ente Ward](https://github.com/...) — local governance app hitting real wards in Kerala.
- Cooking **AIMDAO** — AI-managed DAOs that don’t suck.
- Experimenting with Web3 voting for a *whole country*
- Random side quests: toy car e-commerce, AI dev tools, indie apps.

---

## 🎢 Recent Wins & Fails
+ Got Ente Ward running in a real ward with actual citizens using it  
+ AIMDAO prototype now survives chaos testing without catching fire  
– Spent 3 days fixing a bug that was just a missing semicolon  
– Tried to use a “no-code tool” for speed… ended up coding the whole thing anyway

---

## 🖤 Build Philosophy
- No fake productivity tools. Trello boards rot. Docs collect dust.  
- If it’s not shipped, it doesn’t exist.  
- 80% done is just “not done”.
